This project implements an Arduino based access control solution
including a LCD display, Real Time Clock and time registers on a micro
SD card. The project has been uploaded as a "ready to compile"
version.  This means that if your Hardware matches & all requirements
have been properly installed, you won't need to adjust anything else
on the code, except from the specific RFID tag's key.
(SEE README.md->INSTALATION REQUIREMENTS).

HOW TO USE:

1- Go to ,,authorized_keys.h" and modify the NUID of your authorized
tags (IN DECIMAL FORMAT) as well as the corresponding Names of each
Tag. More info see the MRFC 522 examples.

2- Open the file ,,pin_layout.h" and follow or modify the proposed
connections for the HW.

3- Open Your Arduino IDE v.1.8.0 (not tested in any other), verify,
upload and try your cards!

4- Remove the SD card, and read it from a PC, you should find a file
called ,,records.csv". You can open and further use this file in any
spreadsheet program such as ,,LibreOffice Calc".
