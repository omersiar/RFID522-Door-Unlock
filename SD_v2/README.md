This project implements an Arduino based access control solution
including a LCD display, Real Time Clock and time registers on a micro
SD card. The project has been uploaded as a "ready to compile"
version.  This means that if your Hardware matches & all requirements
have been properly installed, you won't need to adjust anything else
on the code, except from the specific RFID tag's key.

There are two versions of the same project, the one uses Arduino IDE
and the other uses the Makefile system (Linux).

If you want to use the Arduino IDE version go to --> access_control

If you want to use the Makefile build version go to --> Makefile_Build
