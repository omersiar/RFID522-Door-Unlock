This project implements an Arduino based access control solution
including a LCD display, Real Time Clock and time registers on a micro
SD card. The project has been uploaded as a "ready to compile"
version.  This means that if your Hardware matches & all requirements
have been properly installed, you won't need to adjust anything else
on the code, except from the specific RFID tag's key.
